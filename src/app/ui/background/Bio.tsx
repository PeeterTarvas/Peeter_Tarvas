            Hi, I am a Software Developer with an aim of creating good quality applications, currently specializing
        mainly on E2E test development but also doing other things on the side.
        Also I am very fond of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
        Besides IT related topics I also like to enjoy nature, working out and skateboarding :)
